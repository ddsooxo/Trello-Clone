# Trello-Clone(MEAN stack app)

## Description
This is a project I completed for LearnTech Labs bootcamp. The assignment was to create a clone
of an popular app called Trello which is used by many
developers and technical project managers for project planning.
Itâ€™s not just a simple todo, its a todo app with a lot of different components with it.
You can create an account and create mutiple new boards with lists and items.

## Technologies Used
MEAN(MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, and NodeJS) Stack - In simple words, AngualrJS is my front-end and 
ExpressJS/MongoDB is my backend, and NodeJS is in the middle to send information back and forth using API calls.

 
## Getting Started
Main things to install are Node and NPM. You also need to downland mongoDB and mongoose. To run the app, you need angular, mongodb, and
node server running.
